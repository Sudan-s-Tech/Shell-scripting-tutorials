=================================
permissions:  Default settings
owner: 
Access:Read and Write
Group:
other(to someone) access:  Read-Only
Execute: Allow executing file as program  (X)

======================================
Read = numeric value 4
Write = 2
Execute = 1
The "numeric" values are used by the chmod command. The octal representation of these
values is 0621, which corresponds to the permissions shown above.

umask  - system variable 
=====
show 4digits - 0022

666-022    read & write 
775-022    rwxrwxr-x   group has execute permission
777-022    rwxrwxrwx   everyone can do everything
If you want a file or directory to be readable only by its owner, use umask
022         r--r--r--   no one can read it
If you want files created in that directory to have the same rights as the parent
directory, use umask 002. If you want all new files to be executable,
use umask 011. To make sure that newly created directories will also inherit
the default permissions from their parent directory, use umask 000.
A common practice for setting the umask on Unix systems is to set it to 02
