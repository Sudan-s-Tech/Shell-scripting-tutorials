cat > test
This is a ascii text file

cat test

dd if=test of=out conv=ucase  //if-input file   , of-output file  conv-convert

cat out

dd if=test of=test2 conv=ebcdic
cat test2
\
The output from the first dd command shows that it has converted all characters to uppercase. The second
dd command converts the ASCII input file "test" to EBCDIC and stores the result in
the file "test2". When you type "cat test2", you see that this file contains
EBCDIC characters, not ASCII.</s>
